## ✅ Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean, layered architecture:

```

lib/
├── presentation/      # UI: widgets, screens, themes, viewmodels
├── application/       # Business logic: use cases, services, commands
├── domain/            # Core domain: entities, value objects, interfaces
├── infrastructure/    # Data layer: APIs, DB, local storage
├── core/              # Shared utils: constants, logging, errors, extensions
└── main.dart          # Entry point: sets up DI, routing, theming
